                        <h2>Hello World!</h2>
                        <p>Welcome! Do you plan to attend Portland State University and
                            pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science? You're
                            in the right spot!
                        </p>
                        <p>This place is a one stop for all your questions related to Computer
                            Science department, courses, faculty, internships, etc. at Portland
                            State University.
                            Let's get started! Feel free to navigate through topics above and
                            find answers to all the questions. We have added a general section
                            for information about CPT & OPT. This will give you more details about CPT, the
                            types of OPT and how these programs actually work. Please redirect any additional
                            queries to any of our kind contributors in the contacts section.
                        </p>
                        <p>The main idea behind creating this space is to give you fast and quick
                            access to information. Most people including ourselves in the past have
                            reached out to current PSU students or Alumni on social networking platforms
                            to find out more details about the university. Not all the people are responsive
                            or they might be involved in much more important work at the time. Later, there is
                            high possibility they might forget your message and cannot respond. We have all been
                            in such situations previously, kindly understand that it is purely a result of more
                            important things. If you are requesting any time-sensitive information
                            and we do not respond in a timely manner it might affect your chances. Well, we don't want
                            that to happen. Hence this website.
                        </p>

                                Previously at PSU, there used to be two different applications, one for PSU and the other for the
                                Department of Computer Science.
                                Recently, it has been changed to only <em><strong>one</strong></em> single application to both the University and the
                                Graduate program.

                                <p>These courses must be passed with a grade of <b>B</b> or better.
                                    It is highly recommended to take these courses
                                    as early as possible in your graduate program (Preferably first year of your Master's).
                                    These courses are often considered to be the <b><i>most</i></b> challenging courses at PSU. If in any of these courses,
                                    you receive a grade lower than B (B- and below), you will have to retake the course.
                                    These courses are minimum requirements to complete your graduation and obtain a degree.
                                </p>

                                    There are 7 Tracks in total at PSU. Below are in-depth details about each and every track.
                                    Given 45-credits for graduate degree, it is quite common to complete two different tracks along
                                    the course of your graduate program. This opens up more opportunities in the job market. But,
                                    If you are keen on learning only one track, become the master of it.

                        <h3>Credits for Internship</h3>
                        <p>The Computer Science department allows students to take a maximum of 9-credits per term towards internship.
                            But, none of these credits will be counted towards to your degree or graduation.
                        </p>
                        <p><ins>Typical scenarios for Internships:</ins> <br></br>
                            Generally, students are required to be enrolled for atleast 9-credits per term to maintain a full-time international
                            student status. So, when a student secures an internship he/she might opt to take 'x' credits towards internship & 'y' credits
                            towards coursework. Here, 'x' being between 1-9 and 'y' between 0-8.
                            <br></br>
                            <ins>Examples:</ins> <br></br>
                                Internship (1 credit) + Coursework (8 credits) <br></br>
                                Internship (3 credits) + Coursework (6 credits)
                            <p> In any of the above cases, credits taken for internship should be paid for and won't be considered in the 45-credits.</p>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h3>Internship Eligibility</h3>
                            <li>According to the USCIS regulations, any international student is eligible for internships only after completing 9-months
                            of education in the United States.</li>
                            <li>The computer science department at PSU requires all the students to complete atleast two of the three core courses
                            to be eligible for an internship.</li>
